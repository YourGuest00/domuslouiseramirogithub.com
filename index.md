## Community Guidelines and Contributing to Issues

We welcome contributions and engagement from our community! To ensure our GitHub issue tracker remains an effective tool for project development, please observe the following guidelines:

*   **Purpose of the Issue Tracker:** This tracker is primarily for reporting bugs, proposing features, and discussing technical aspects directly related to the project's codebase and documentation.
*   **What Belongs Here:**
    *   **Bug Reports:** Clearly describe unexpected behavior, including steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results.
    *   **Feature Requests:** Suggest new functionalities, explaining their value and potential implementation.
    *   **Technical Discussions:** Engage in discussions about project architecture, technical decisions, or implementation strategies.
*   **What Does NOT Belong Here:**
    *   **General Discussions or Personal Reflections:** For broader conversations, personal thoughts, or off-topic content, please use designated community channels such as the project's 'Discussions' tab (if enabled), a community forum, or social media groups.
    *   **Support Questions:** For general usage questions not related to bugs or features, please check our documentation or community forums first.

By following these guidelines, you help us maintain a focused and productive environment for all contributors.
